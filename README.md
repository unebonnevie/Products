Hi,

Thank you for looking at *SOME* of my own products that I created off spare
times.  Please see my resume' for the professionally/marketed products that I
worked at on at Amazon, etc.

I am very passionate about firmware & HW with retro and modern techonologies.

The names of the files for the images should give you some hints about the
products.

All my products are named as "EG-XXXX", where "EG" stands for "Embedded Guy."

Thank you!

Regards,

Alex Le
